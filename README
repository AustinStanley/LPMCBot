This is an IRC bot written in Python. It is meant to be simple as a starting point so that LPMC learners can learn from it and add features/functionality.

The bot can be started in a few ways:
    - Interactive Mode
        Start the bot with '-i' or '--interactive' and it will prompt for a few
        settings.
        EXAMPLE: 'python2 lpmcbot.py -i'

    - Environment Variables
        The settings can be passed to the bot by environment variables.
        EXAMPLE:
            'NICK="MyNick" USER="MyUser" CHANNEL="#MyChannel" python2 lpmcbot.py'

    - Default Values
        If no argument is passed and no environment variables are found, the bot
        will use the default values.
